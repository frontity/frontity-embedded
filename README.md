# Frontity - Embedded Mode

For a full explanation please refer to the [Embedded mode documentation](https://api.frontity.org/frontity-plugins/embedded-mode). If you have any questions related to the plugin feel free to share them in [Frontity community forum](https://community.frontity.org/).

## Install

1. First of all you have to install the plugin. You can do it:
   - **Automatic**: from within WordPress dashboard go to Plugins, click Add New button, search for Frontity Embedded Mode by Frontity and click Install Now.
   - **Manual**: this method requires to download the plugin and upload it to your web server via FTP. For a more detailed explanation, WordPress explains how to do this [on this guide](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).
2. Once installed, you have to activate it, go to Settings -> Frontity Embedded Mode, and define the proper Frontity Server Url. and it will be running!

> Revisions are necessary to do post previews, so make sure those are activated for both your posts, pages and any custom post types.

## Environment Variables

You can also use an environment variable instead of changing the URL in the plugin interface.

```php
> FRONTITY_SERVER=https://myfrontityserver.com
```

## WordPress Constant

Lastly a PHP constant can be defined. This would usually be done in the wp-config.php file.

```
define( 'FRONTITY_SERVER', 'https://myfrontityserver.com' );
```

Note that if the PHP constant exists, it takes precedence over both the environment variable and the settings page setting.

## Static Assets

If you need, you can change the folder or URL where your static assets are stored using the `--public-path` option of the `npx frontity build` command.

### Example: Frontity in the same WordPress server

If you are using the same server for both WordPress and Frontity, and your Frontity project is at `/wp-content/frontity`, your static folder will be at `https://yourdomain.com/wp-content/frontity/build/static`.

You can change the folder when you run `npx frontity build` like this:

```bash
> npx frontity build --public-path /wp-content/frontity/build/static
```

### Example: Frontity in an external server

If you deployed Frontity in an external hosting service, like for example Vercel, you can use the `--public-path` option to point directly to the Vercel URL:

```bash
> npx frontity build --public-path https://myfrontityapp.now.sh/static
```

## Local Development

If you want to use the Embedded mode while you are developing in your local environment, you can do so by using the `--public-path` parameter in the `npx frontity dev` command as well:

```bash
> npx frontity dev --public-path http://localhost:3000/static
```
